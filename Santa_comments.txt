    This semester in Advanced Programming in Python, we covered the topics of the usage of string, list, tuple, dictionary. We have also practice how to define and apply functions to code. In addition to daily homework and problem sets, we had an in-class test, a cumulative final exam, and three partner project. A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable code when necessary as well as clearly communicate their understanding of programming concepts.
