    This semester in Advanced Programming in Python, we covered the topics of the usage of string, list, tuple, dictionary. We have also practice how to define and apply functions to code. In addition to daily homework and problem sets, we had an in-class test, a cumulative final exam, and three partner project. A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable code when necessary as well as clearly communicate their understanding of programming concepts.
    You are stellar engaging, humorous, and collaborative student during class. You showed up to 98% of class! You bring a interesting and relevent questions to class and stay on topic during class. You are active in your learning process and love to engage in the material.You add a layer of humour to our material that is appreciated by all.You are really comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussion and you work well in small groups with your peers.
